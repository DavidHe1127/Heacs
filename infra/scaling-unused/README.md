## Notes

Solution demonstrated here is a tf implementation of strategy described in this [post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatic-scaling-with-amazon-ecs/). It is kinda old approach when comparing to Cluster Auto scaling with capacity provider + ECS Service auto-scaling.

But it's still retained as a future reference.

Please refer to `ecs` tf module for to-date implementations.
