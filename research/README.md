## Resource Stack

Use CloudFormation to quickly provision resources aiming for getting me to better
understand AWS cloud computing/networking etc. The resources provisioned will not be used
in main dockerzon resource stack.

Reason I decided to use CF is I want to play with it to see the difference compared to using Terraform.
